Command Arg1 Arg2 (SubCommand Arg1 Arg2)
Commands can be called to return a stream of any length
Args can be commands that return streams
The result of the root is printed
Commands are basically maps of on stream to another
square brackets [] can be used to convert a list of arguments into a stream:
"new [a b c d]" will create files a b c and d

OS
has repl
has separate command instruction format to perform tasks:
DEL file
INS smth
MOV file
Only read operations can be executed by commands
Output of Commands can be executed using X
X without commands executes the last output
X with command executes that command as system
All operations can be undone. This adds the REV instruction to the history
--
Edit/Debug/Fix cycle:
!write (edit (read 'somefile)) 'somefile
(Editor is now open, when quit a system command is printed to stdout)
x

Commands should execute instantly. Tasks can be scheduled by the OS:

```
IN 5 write log
```

## Command Parameters

**Example:**

```
combine{sep="  ", all} commands (describe commands)
```

`all` is a boolean flag.

## Commands That Take Commands

Commands can be passed as strings, or using the special syntax that will check
if the command is valid:

```
alias 'ls "files"
```

```
alias 'ls <show files>
```

Syntax error: show is not a command.

## Functions

Functions are user-defined commands. They take parameters, input streams and
generate an output stream.

**Example:**

```
function{sep} 'print $1 
```
