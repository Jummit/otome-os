Command Arg1 Arg2 (SubCommand Arg1 Arg2)
Commands can be called to return a stream of any length
Args can be commands that return streams
The result of the root is printed
Commands are basically maps of on stream to another
square brackets [] can be used to convert a list of arguments into a stream:
"new [a b c d]" will create files a b c and d

OS
has repl
has separate command instruction format to perform tasks:
DEL file
INS smth
MOV file
Only read operations can be executed by commands
Output of Commands can be executed using X
X without commands executes the last output
X with command executes that command as system
All operations can be undone. This adds the REV instruction to the history
--
Edit/Debug/Fix cycle:
!write (edit (read 'somefile)) 'somefile
(Editor is now open, when quit a system command is printed to stdout)
x

TODO:
example command
add config to commands where it makes sense
type check config
virtual execution of scripts (remove confirm)
allow documentation of user functions
multiple return values / vararg
folders and then also paths sigh.
multiline (wait until everything is closed)
define functions with config and parameters
save history to disk
pass functions to functions
escaping in strings
catogories for commands
job control (schedule tasks)
refactor this mess. maybe add type hints and comments?
difference between number, bool and string streams: type checking
port this whole thing to rust | use https://github.com/osch/lua-nocurses
autocompletion wow (need a custom text input for that)
cache commands
write something usefull with this
fancy frontend with autocompletion
make it a game? Or maybe an actual shell?
UTF8 support

DONE: Tests
Strings
List sugar
Aliases (removed in favor of functions)
Error handling
stream manipulation commands
execute a file or string
Parameters (config options for commands)
define functions
define functions with parameters
remove aliases in favor of functions
callables (commands as parameters)
confirm in scripts (replaced by immediate execution)
math operators
comparison operators
Flow control: loops (with 'give'), conditions (with 'when')
commands have no side effects

Project inspired by: Bash, ZSH, Exapunks, Blender Geometry Nodes, Lisp/Functional Programming, TIC80.

Commands should execute instantly. Tasks can be scheduled by the OS:

```
IN 5 write log
```

## Command Parameters

**Example:**

```
combine{sep="  ", values='all} commands (describe commands)
```

Multiple keys can be assigned to one stream:

```
render{time,color,camera=(read 'config)} (read time=10 'cube)
```

is the same as

```
render{time=10,color='red,camera='normal} (read time=10 'cube)
```

## Functions

Functions are user-defined commands. They take parameters, input streams and
generate an output stream.

**Example:**

```
function 'myjoin{sep = "  "} (join $1 sep) 
```

These should replace aliases. (DONE)

### Documenting Functions

```
function 'myjoin{sep = "  "} (join $1 sep) 
describe 'myjoin "Join strings by separator\n\nA longer example: myjoin{sep=}\n\n\nNOTE: this is pretty useless"
args 'myjoin ["separator"]
```

## Passing Functions to Functions

Functions can take other functions as parameters and call them:

```
function about (combine $1 (resize ": " 100) ($2 $1))
about functions :describe
```

## Executing Scripts

Scripts can be run with the `run` command. The are executed in a virtual
environment which is only applied when the script is successfull.
The `undo` command undos the last run command by default.

## Multiple Return Values

```
equalize 
```
