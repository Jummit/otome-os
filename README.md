Command Arg1 Arg2 (SubCommand Arg1 Arg2)
Commands can be called to return a stream of any length
Args can be commands that return streams
The result of the root is printed
Commands are basically maps of on stream to another
square brackets [] can be used to convert a list of arguments into a stream:
"new [a b c d]" will create files a b c and d
for now, use list

OS
has repl
has separate command instruction format to perform tasks:
DEL file
INS smth
MOV file
Only read operations can be executed by commands
Output of Commands can be executed using X
X without commands executes the last output
X with command executes that command as system
All operations can be undone. This adds the REV instruction to the history
